Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Mudit Singh

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
www.muditsingh.online

3. What's the URL of your git repo?
https://github.com/muditF1/CS5610-Assignment-03

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
75%

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes deployed.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Not at all. No where near even understanding this launguage.
I am finding it very tough to get the concepts epecially coming from
a Java background. I think it will take good amount of time to even
start deploying production stuff with this language. I have very low
confidence on ramping up on this language in quick time.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Setup was definetly a pain, there are too many unknows which we faced, like 502, deployment etc.

Getting the logic of the implementation was easy, however, doing it with elixir was a total blind spot.
With very little clue in terms of understanding the language and already written code. Had to put in
huge amount of energy and effort, only to get this much done, it is inversely proportional. I think
i will continue to face troubles with elixir given the design of our course.
